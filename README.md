# React starter kit using Parcel as bundler
This starter kit is kind of a copy of create-react-app, but without the webpack composant. It aims to emulate what create-react-app does right out of the box, but permits you to use your own Service Workers without ejecting the project.

## How to use
First, clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Nhiokh/react-parcel-starter-kit my-project
cd my-project
```

Then, install the dependencies

```
npm install or yarn install
```

You're good to go. Just use one of the following scripts

## Two scripts
Depending on what you're using :

### Starting development environment

```
npm start or yarn start
```

This starts a dev server which on port 1234 (access via localhost:1234).
Hot reloading is available right out of the box.


### Starting building your app for production

```
npm build or yarn build   
```
